            <h2>🍁 Rouyn Noranda Welcomes You. 🍁</h2>
            <h3>Information Architecture- Group 2</h3>
            <h4>May 16 2022</h4>
            <br/>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Rouyn-Noranda is a small town in Northern Quebec in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, with a population of over 42 000
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project will look at the way information is organized for non-locals, who know less about the town, vs locals, who
              tend to know more. The website caters more towards established locals because of how information centered around already
              living there is concentrated in a smaller number of clearly labeled areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to reconfigure the navigation to make it easier and more efficient for non- locals, be it tourists or
              newcomers, to access the information they need about the town.
            </p>

            <h4>Major Content Items</h4>
            <p>
              Information presented on the homepage shows five categories. We will be focusing on the English version of the website.
            </p>
            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>
              There is a bunch of content on how the town came to be starting off as multiple different settlements. Each settlement
              had something unique about them and eventually the communities came together to form Rouyn-Noranda.

            </p>
            <h5>Visiting/ Newcomers</h5>
            <p>
              Resources and information for visiting tourists who want to sight- see as well as needed sources for new faces who want
              to move to the area and adjust to a new life there.
            </p>
            <h5>Business</h5>
            <p>
              Mining and metallurgy are the driving economic industries of the area, but many smaller businesses can thrive too. Here
              are the resources and information needed for such ventures. There are resources for contractors who want to work with
              local businesses too.
            </p>
            <h5>Transportation</h5>
            <p>
              Different methods of getting to the area via provincial highways, local highways or the Rouyn airport. The Rouyn airport
              is also useful for commercial travel. Information on public transport is also listed.

            </p>
            <h5>Life in Rouyn-Noranda</h5>
            <p>
              What is it like to live in this town as a student? What about a full-time worker with a family? There are also several
              events held in town at various points of the year to get more involved and different municipal organizations to get
              involved within the local political scene.
            </p>

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <h5>Persona 1</h5>
            <p>Ron. The new graduate who wants to start life in a small town.</p>
            <h5>Persona 2</h5>
            <p>Janine. The tourist who wants to get to know rural Canada.</p>

            <h4>Scenarios</h4>
            <h5>Scnario 1</h5>
            <p>
              You found a town to have a new start in.
            </p>
            <h5>Scenario 2</h5>
            <p>
              You are visiting rural Canada for the first time.
            </p>
            <h5>Scenario 3</h5>
            <p>
              You are looking for work in Rouyn-Noranda.
            </p>

            <h3>Testing Process</h3>
            <h4>Content Inventory</h4>
            <p>Our group proceeded to lay out the website's information architecture into a content inventory, using each component of
            the main navigation, there was a total of 113 content items.</p>
            <h5>Purpose</h5>
            <p>The inventory would help the group understand the main components of the website and evaluate a more efficient
            organizational scheme for the user.</p>
            <h5>What we learned</h5>
            <p>There were too many links in the website's main navigation. Certain pages contained links that lead to other parts of
            the navigation. The existing category names were unclear at what information they presented based on the user scenario
            possibilities. Localization added to the ambiguity of the naming conventions of the navigation.</p>
            
            <br/>

            <h4>Card Sorts</h4>
            <p>From the initial content inventory, areas of opportunity to reorganize were found. Three card sorts were conducted: Open
            card sort, closed card sort, and another closed card sort for validation purposes. Our group used OptimalSort to conduct
            the card sort testings. Participants were recruited by family, friends and social media connections. The following
            sections are the results and changes.</p>
            <h5>Round 1: Open</h5>
            <p>There were 2 parcipants for the first card sort as a pilot card sort, with 3 iterations per participant. This was an
            open card sort.</p>
            <h6>Results</h6>
            <h5>Round2: Closed</h5>
            <p>There were 6 participants for the second card sort. This was a closed card sort.</p>
            <h6>Results</h6>
            <h6>Needs Changes?</h6>
            <h5>Round 3: Closed, validation</h5>
            <p>This closec card sort serves to validate the result of the second round of card sorts.</p>
            <h6>Results</h6>

            <h4>Task Based Tests</h4>
            <h5>Treejack Test</h5>
            <h6>Tasks</h6>
            <p>You are visiting rural Canada for the first time. You're looking for something to do. Where would you look for that
            information?</p>
            <p>You want to move to a small town, but it's a big step? Where could you find information to start the moving process?</p>
            <p>You settled in to Rouyn-Noranda, but you need to find work to pay the bills. Where would you find that information?</p>

            <h3>A Look into the Nuance of UX from a Programmer</h3>
            <p>
              Technology as a field is a vast field that extends more than what people outside the domain expect it to be often. As
              someone who comes from an artistic background learning programming, this has been confirmed again and again throughout
              my time studying computer science. The concentration of human computer interaction, often colloquially referred to as
              UX, has been the most enlightening part in seeing the intricacies of how people interact with technology. From the
              developer's side, who tends to focus on the code that builds an application, I've found that the information extracted
              from user centered tests involving prototypes to have the most nuance in planning out a software product.
            </p>

              The Tiny Fingers article by Mark Rettig talked about the advantages of a paper prototype mainly. Some of the ideas
              discussed started with how the field of human computer interaction evolved from the emphasis on software and fidelity to
              the efficiency of low fidelity and how important that can be. The advantages of the low fidelity were explained in the
              context of the timeline of a product's development so this offered efficiency benefits because it's cheap and easy to
              change making iteration easier to streamline through.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              As mentioned, going with a high-fidelity prototype from the start has the risk of not getting enough valuable
              information from such a detailed prototype early in the development process (Rettig 1994). The kind of valuable
              information in question can potentially speak to how well the usability measures to the user. According to Rettig,
              developers can prioritize usability more during the planning stages of the project. This allows for the “formative
              evaluation” Rettig explains in detail in the article.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire process from ideation to prototyping is consistent with what is taught in DePaul's User Centered Design
              class. From what has been taught so far in this prototyping class, the development process is the same (because both
              classes explore the same field), except students will have the opportunity to dive more into the later stages of the
              development process of UX (where in contrast, the start of the process focused more on the research aspects of UX). Both
              of the aforementioned articles from Erickson and Rettig explore the standard development and design process in detail.
              The ideation part of the process does share similarities to how a programmer would plan out how to implement a software,
              but the high-level concepts differ.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              The Notes on Design paper seems to focus more on the design and development process in the scope of how large
              organizations handle it, so good communication becomes tantamount to the project's chance of success. Although they do
              bring up the communicative aspect of individual work through the importance of physical artifacts in the design process
              (Erickson 1995). Furthermore, the influences at what kicks off the communication over the project is also multi-faceted.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a bigger focus in the Erickson paper about the different audiences that come up during the design and
              development cycle of an application or product, however unlike the Tiny Fingers article. The diversity of one single
              facet of an audience, like the design team as mentioned, is considered more and what kind of knowledge the varying
              disciplines contribute to the project at hand (Erickson 1995).
            </p>
            <p>
              Erickson also goes into more detail about design artefacts that Rettig doesn't focus on as much, stories. The story's
              role in the design and development process explained by both authors play the part in considering how users would
              approach a certain problem using the product the designers are trying to design and develop, or a “framework” (Erickson
              1995). Because of how unpredictable users can be, stories help consider that ambiguity before any solid plan is fully
              committed to. This would mean that designers are given a fair degree of adaptability to work with during the beginning
              stages of the design process, what Erickson calls the “exploratory stage” (Erickson 1995). To add on to the use of
              stories, Erickson goes onto explain the equalizing benefits of them in the team project, similar to the low fidelity
              prototype that comes up later in the process (Erickson 1995). To summarize, because both authors use the context of a
              large organization to explain their individual concepts, UX teams in bigger organizations tend to have various
              disciplines because it's such a collaborative field. Stories help get across concepts that may normally only be clear to
              certain disciplines if discussed formally.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              In the field of UX, especially in large organizations both authors use to contextualize the type of project that's
              common enough to explain in such articles, teams that design a product and develop it can have people from so many
              different fields and disciplines. Likewise, the development stages explained in the Notes on Design Paper are emphasized
              as not “clearly separated” unlike the Tiny Fingers article (Erickson 1995). Take the Refinement stage for example, where
              the project is at a point where the designers know what the product is supposed to accomplish (Erickson 1995). However,
              the planning and discussions involved here lends to what is discussed by Rettig when the benefits of the lo-fi prototype
              in the process get explained more in detail in terms of determining requirements for the project. This is where Rettig
              describes preparing for testing. Returning to the core of what both mentioned articles share, prototypes, designers must
              consider that each kind of prototype made will be used for different kinds of information gathering. The testing Rettig
              describes includes the use of low fidelity prototyping, but the information there is to convey the overall concept of a
              product (Erickson 1995). Designers at this point tend to not prioritize the interactivity in their prototype just yet.
              That's saved for when more data is gathered.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              From what I have learned in DePaul's User Centered Design class, the low fidelity prototype our team built did in fact
              go through several iterations just as Rettig's examples had, although the difference there is we used a low fidelity
              software prototype to get around location differences between the group of designers and the users we tested the
              prototype with. The reasoning for low fidelity included the tight deadline but the ease at adding changes with each user
              test was easier to grasp in practice than in theory. The “vision prototype” acted closely to a low fidelity prototype
              because it's generally quite easy to get lost in adding details when working with a software prototype. The biggest
              challenge to this phase of our team's product development is the very advantage Erickson described when the development
              stages were ambiguously separated (Erickson 1995). It may help in flexibility in planning but to a design team that is
              still figuring out their baring's into a new field, it makes gauging the team progress incredibly difficult. With a
              tight time, frame of a school project, there isn't always time for lengthy discussions of ideas. Plus, some of our group
              members were new to the high-level concepts involved in UX, what Erickson calls the “exploratory stage” (Erickson 1995).
              
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, technological projects that heavily rely on users have a nuance in their high-level concepts that contrast
              starkly to the high-level concepts one would find in programming. The user adds a layer of unpredictability that poses
              both a flexibility and obstacle to how to tackle a problem. And that's if the team of designers can figure out what the
              problem is at hand. This is why prototyping plays such a vital role in UX, whether that team of designers is
              multidisciplinary or not. That data gathered thanks to the prototyping and testing lets the team know how to move
              forward.

            <h3>Idea and Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              The availability of public bathrooms for tourists and locals is not always obvious in major cities like Chicago. The
              existing mobile applications do not always have the most updated location despite having other details like keys,
              cleanliness, and accessibility information. This product will focus on providing the most accurate, detailed, and
              extensive list of public restrooms in any city. The PeezyFind mobile and smart watch application will include maps and
              augmented reality to aid the user in finding the most efficient way to the nearest public restroom.
            </p>

              Sketches during Charette
            </h3>
            <p>
              The sketches below provide a visual to the ideation and design charette phase of product development. The primary
              focus
              was on the augmented reality functionality therefore, a mobile phone interface was the first one that was considered.
              After developing the mobile interface sketches, the addition of a smart watch interface became a simple integration.
              Current mobile map applications have an option of also using a smart watch for navigation. Figure 2.0 details sketches
              for the added smart watch interface.
            
              An obstacle that came up during the sketching portion of the charette was whether our product would need a profile and
              log in feature (illustrated in Figure 1.2). There is a bigger convenience to the user not needing to log in to search
              public restrooms in their area, so Figure 3.0 focuses on that user situation.

                      After a few weeks of mentally preparing and researching local attractions for a big family gathering, Eden double checks
                      for spots her family wanted to see the most. She checks the application for where the local public bathrooms are in the
                      area and their proximity to the sights. This will ensure the aunts and uncles know where to take their younger kids in
                      case any of them need to use the bathroom or if any accidents happen. After finding all that information she sends the
                      location links to her family before she meets up with them.

                    <li>
                      During the trip one of the aunties tells Eden that one of the kids needs a restroom and they want to make sure they
                      understand the link Eden sent. Eden shows them how the directions work and how to get to the list of details about a
                      specific location while her younger cousin is squirming next to Eden's aunty.

                    <li>
                      Since the family sightseeing trip went well, Eden realizes the app could be useful for her
                      own day trips exploring neighborhoods she has not gotten the chance to see much of yet,
                      and knowing where public bathrooms are will help make the trip more bearable.

                  accessible public restrooms. Her previous encounters with untrustworthy restroom-finding applications had left her

                    with thorough cleanliness and accessibility ratings. The program plotted these facilities on a map, allowing her to
                    readily locate neighboring restrooms that fit her requirements. She easily approached her selected restroom using
                    PeezyFinder's navigation and augmented reality features, confident that it would be clean and accessible as promised.

                  <li>After:
                    essica was pleased with her time in Chicago, owing to PeezyFinder's aid. She finished her explorations in the city's
                    attractions, restaurants, and cultural institutions without having to worry about seeking a restroom. Her great
                    experience prompted her to submit a nice comment on the app store, thanking PeezyFinder for helping to make her visit
                    memorable and stress-free. Jessica also happily suggested the app to her companions, knowing it would improve their

            <h4>Takeaways & Suggestions for PeezyFind post-analysis:</h4>
            <p>
              The key features of similar applications listed in the competition analysis show heavy similarities, so to stand out,
              PeezyFind would have to provide a more extensive overview of amenities in a more customizable way. Below are key points,
              considering physical & emotional needs to users, business monetization and effective experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                User-Centric Design: Prioritize user comfort and ease during restroom searches. Implement features like a “Rush
                Restroom” for urgent situations, which directs users to the nearest available restroom and provides a reassuring
                message.
              </li>
              <li>
                Restroom Partnerships: Collaborate with businesses to promote their restrooms within the app. Offer businesses
                advertising space, featured listings, and cleanliness rating boosts in exchange for sponsorship.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adaptive UI: Implement an adaptive user interface that adjusts to different device types and screen sizes, optimizing
                the experience for both mobile and smartwatch users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inclusive Restroom Categories: Include a category for "Gender-Neutral Restrooms" that users can select to find restrooms
                suitable for everyone. Emphasize the importance of inclusive restroom facilities for all gender identities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accessibility Icons: Use clear accessibility icons or symbols to indicate restrooms that are wheelchair accessible. This
                helps users quickly identify restrooms suitable for those with mobility challenges.
              </li>
              <li>
                Virtual Queues: In some cases, users may encounter restrooms with predictable but busy periods, such as during
                intermissions at events, during peak travel times, or in busy shopping areas. Joining a virtual queue can provide them
                with an estimated wait time, allowing them to plan their restroom break more effectively.
              </li>
            </ul>
